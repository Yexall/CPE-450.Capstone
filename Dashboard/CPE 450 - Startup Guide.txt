Step 1: Open the Control Panel
	- On your computer, click the Start button and type "Control Panel" in the search bar.
Step 2: Navigate to Network and Security
	- Look for an option labeled 'Network and Security' and click on it.
Step 3: Access the Ethernet Adapter Settings
	- Within 'Network and Security', look for 'Network and Sharing Center' or a similar link.
	- Then, find and click on 'Change adapter settings'.
Step 4: Modify the Ethernet Adapter
	- Right-click on the Ethernet adapter that you wish to configure and select 'Properties'.
	- In the 'Properties' window, locate 'Internet Protocol Version 4' (TCP/IPv4) in the list.
	- Click on it to highlight it, then click the Properties button.
Step 5: Enter the New IP Configuration
	- Select the option 'Use the following IP address'.
	- Enter a new IP address (Use the machine's IP address but add 1, 2 or 3 to the last number).
	- Enter the same subnet mask that the machine is using.
	- Type in the default gateway as "192.168.10.1" (This connects the adapter to the machine via the Ethernet interface labeled eth0).

*** The following steps was done using the cppagent version v2.4.0.9. Future versions should be relatively the same ***
Step 1: Download cppagent
	- Open your browser and go to the official cppagent repository: https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent
	- Scroll down to the 'Releases' section.
	- Download the latest version of cppagent for Windows. The file will be in .zip format.
Step 2: Extract the Files
	- Locate the downloaded .zip file (usually in your Downloads folder).
	- Right-click the file and select 'Extract All'.
	- Choose a location to extract the files (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64).
	- Click 'Extract' and wait for the process to complete.
Step 3: Locate the Executable
	- Open the extracted folder.
	- Inside, navigate to the bin directory. This is where the main executable (agent.exe) is located.
Step 4: Open a Terminal and Navigate to the bin Folder
	- To run cppagent, you need to open a terminal and change the directory to the bin folder.
	- Use the cd command to navigate to the bin folder: cd "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\bin"
		- Replace YourName with your actual Windows username.
Step 5: Verify cppagent is Working
	- To confirm cppagent is working, type: .\agent.exe
	- This will display a list of available commands. The format for running cppagent is: .\agent.exe COMMAND
		- Replace COMMAND with one of the available commands from the list.
Step 6: Locate the Configuration File
	- For cppagent to run, it requires a configuration file. The default file is named agent.cfg and is located in the folders: demo/agent/agent.cfg
	- 2 Options for Using the Config File:
		1. Move the agent.cfg File: Copy agent.cfg to the bin directory where agent.exe is located.
							OR
		2. If you donâ€™t want to move the file, run cppagent with the full path to agent.cfg: .\agent.exe run "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\demo\agent\agent.cfg"
Step 7: Run cppagent
	- 2 Options to run cppagent. 
		1. If you went with option 1 in Step 6: .\agent.exe run agent.cfg 
						OR 
		2. If you went with option 2 in Step 6: .\agent.exe run "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\demo\agent\agent.cfg" 
	- If you prefer detailed output, change "run" to "debug": .\agent.exe debug agent.cfg
Step 8: Find the Port Number
	- When you run cppagent, the terminal may not explicitly tell you what port it is using. To find the Port: Open agent.cfg in Notepad or any text editor.
	- Look for a line that specifies the port: Port = 5000
		- If no port is listed, the default is usually 5000.
Step 9: Access cppagent in a Browser
	- Open a web browser. Go to: http://localhost:5000/
		- Replace 5000 with the port number from agent.cfg.
	- If everything is set up correctly, you should see an XML response with MTConnect data.

|| Running MTConnect ||
1. cd "C:\Users\yexal\Downloads\cppagent\bin"
2. .\agent.exe run "C:\Users\yexal\Downloads\cppagent\demo\agent\agent.cfg"
3. http://localhost:5001/ 				- Website URL to access the running instance of MTConnect
4. http://192.168.10.10:8082/UMC-500SS/current 		- URL to access machine data. Set to "/probe" (list of data that can be connected), "/current" (list current data) or "/sample" (list data collected wthin a longer period)
