*** The following steps was done using the cppagent version v2.4.0.9. Future versions should be relatively the same ***

Step 1: Download cppagent
	- Open your browser and go to the official cppagent repository: https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent
	- Scroll down to the "Releases" section.
	- Download the latest version of cppagent for Windows. The file will be in .zip format.
Step 2: Extract the Files
	- Locate the downloaded .zip file (usually in your Downloads folder).
	- Right-click the file and select "Extract Allâ€¦".
	- Choose a location to extract the files (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64).
	- Click "Extract" and wait for the process to complete.
Step 3: Locate the Executable
	- Open the extracted folder.
	- Inside, navigate to the bin directory. This is where the main executable (agent.exe) is located.
Step 4: Open a Terminal and Navigate to the bin Folder
	- To run cppagent, you need to open a terminal and change the directory to the bin folder.
	- Use the cd command to navigate to the bin folder: cd "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\bin"
		- Replace YourName with your actual Windows username.
Step 5: Verify cppagent is Working
	- To confirm cppagent is working, type: .\agent.exe
	- This will display a list of available commands. The format for running cppagent is: .\agent.exe COMMAND
		- Replace COMMAND with one of the available commands from the list.
Step 6: Locate the Configuration File
	- For cppagent to run, it requires a configuration file. The default file is named agent.cfg and is located in the folders: demo/agent/agent.cfg
	- 2 Options for Using the Config File:
		1. Move the agent.cfg File: Copy agent.cfg to the bin directory where agent.exe is located.
							OR
		2. If you donâ€™t want to move the file, run cppagent with the full path to agent.cfg: .\agent.exe run "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\demo\agent\agent.cfg"
Step 7: Run cppagent
	- To start cppagent, use: .\agent.exe run agent.cfg 
			OR 
				: .\agent.exe run "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\agent-2.4.0.9-win64\demo\agent\agent.cfg" 
	- If you prefer detailed output: .\agent.exe debug agent.cfg
Step 8: Find the Port Number
	- When you run cppagent, the terminal may not explicitly tell you what port it is using. To find the Port: Open agent.cfg in Notepad or any text editor.
	- Look for a line that specifies the port: Port = 5000
		- If no port is listed, the default is usually 5000.
Step 9: Access cppagent in a Browser
	- Open a web browser. Go to: http://localhost:5000/
		- Replace 5000 with the port number from agent.cfg.
	- If everything is set up correctly, you should see an XML response with MTConnect data.
Step 10: You're Done! ðŸŽ‰
	- Congratulations! cppagent is now running.
